I began my visit in Seoul, Korea, where I had the privilege of joining the team as it observes and celebrates its 30th anniversary of doing business in the market. Thirty years ago, we were the first foreign insurance company in the Korean market, and one of the highlights of my visit was participating in a ceremony commemorating this milestone anniversary, alongside Cigna Korea CEO, Ben Hong and several other colleagues â€“ including one, Kyung Ok Lim, who, remarkably, has been there from day one! A photo with Kyung from the ceremony is below. We recognized the growth this team has contributed to Cigna overall, and its continued opportunity to demonstrate innovation in products, solutions and marketing going forward.
