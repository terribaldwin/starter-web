I began my visit in Seoul, Korea, where I had the privilege of joining the team as it observes and celebrates its 30th anniversary of doing business in the market. Thirty years ago, we were the first foreign insurance company in the Korean market, and one of the highlights of my visit was participating in a ceremony commemorating this milestone anniversary, alongside Cigna Korea CEO, Ben Hong and several other colleagues – including one, Kyung Ok Lim, who, remarkably, has been there from day one! A photo with Kyung from the ceremony is below. We recognized the growth this team has contributed to Cigna overall, and its continued opportunity to demonstrate innovation in products, solutions and marketing going forward. 


In addition to meeting with other colleagues while in Seoul, I also took the opportunity to conduct a media interview with approximately 60 reporters in a joint session, followed by meetings with the governor of the Financial Supervisory Service (Korea’s regulatory arm) to reinforce our commitment to Korea and the importance of our Korean business, and with the interim United States ambassador to the country.
